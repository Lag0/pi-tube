# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-02)

**Core value:** Turn public media inputs into trustworthy, structured, ready-to-use knowledge artifacts fast.
**Current focus:** Phase 4: Transcription Providers (next)

## Current Position

Phase: 4 of 6 (Transcription Providers)
Plan: 0 of 4 executed
Status: Phase 3 complete — ready for Phase 4 planning/execution
Last activity: 2026-03-02 — Phase 3 verified and marked complete

Progress: [█████░░░░░] 48%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 11
- Average duration: 2.4 min
- Total execution time: 0.43 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 1 | 4 | 5 min | 1.3 min |
| 2 | 4 | 6 min | 1.5 min |
| 3 | 3 | 15 min | 5.0 min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 02-03 (2 min), 02-04 (2 min), 03-01 (8 min), 03-02 (4 min), 03-03 (3 min)
- Trend: Elevated but stabilizing

*Updated after each plan completion*
| Phase 03 P01 | 8 min | 3 tasks | 7 files |
| Phase 03 P02 | 4 min | 3 tasks | 6 files |
| Phase 03 P03 | 3 min | 3 tasks | 4 files |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Initialization]: Full cutover to TypeScript + Bun in v1
- [Initialization]: Instagram public post/reel/video in core, public-only policy
- [Initialization]: Markdown default + optional deterministic `--json`
- [Phase 1 Planning]: Contract-first Bun CLI with deterministic placeholder behavior
- [01-01 Execution]: Keep placeholder paths deterministic and non-zero to protect automation correctness.
- [01-02 Execution]: Deferred command verbs stay visible in help but must hard-fail with phase-aware guidance.
- [01-03 Execution]: Legacy command compatibility is guidance-only and never proxies back to Python runtime behavior.
- [01-04 Execution]: Installer and README are treated as contract artifacts and validated by regression tests.
- [02-01 Execution]: Non-YouTube HTTP(S) input must pass direct-media extension policy or fail with `UNSUPPORTED_URL_NOT_DIRECT_MEDIA`.
- [02-01 Execution]: Keep `resolveSource` async and adapter-agnostic to avoid CLI contract churn in later phases.
- [02-02 Execution]: Wrap yt-dlp in a dedicated boundary module and map subprocess failures to stable public error codes.
- [02-02 Execution]: Use dependency injection in adapter tests to mock yt-dlp outcomes deterministically.
- [02-03 Execution]: Normalize accepted direct media URLs by stripping fragments for deterministic source identity.
- [02-03 Execution]: Local-file intake requires existence and supported extension checks before contract handoff.
- [02-04 Execution]: Baseline CLI success output uses `[INTAKE_RESOLVED] kind=...` markers for deterministic integration checks.
- [02-04 Execution]: Provider execution remains deferred to Phase 4 even after Phase 2 intake success.
- [Phase 03]: Instagram public URL support constrained to /p/, /reel/, and /tv/ for deterministic scope — Keeps SRC-02 behavior explicit and avoids unsupported Instagram surfaces.
- [Phase 03]: Instagram extraction reuses yt-dlp boundary with dedicated adapter entrypoint — Preserves adapter architecture and avoids introducing a second extraction stack.
- [Phase 03]: Instagram auth-required signatures map to INSTAGRAM_AUTH_REQUIRED at extractor boundary — CLI must provide deterministic public-only remediation for SRC-03
- [Phase 03]: Instagram non-auth extraction failures remain INSTAGRAM_EXTRACT_FAILED — Prevents confusing remediation when failures are unrelated to authentication
- [Phase 03]: CLI help keeps instagram alias deferred while baseline input path remains authoritative — Maintains stable command contract while Instagram intake runs through pi-tube <input>.
- [Phase 03]: Help and README explicitly mention INSTAGRAM_AUTH_REQUIRED and public-only policy — Improves deterministic troubleshooting for agent and human users.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Instagram extractor stability may fluctuate; keep adapter isolation and smoke tests active.
