## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Initialization]: Full cutover to TypeScript + Bun in v1
- [Initialization]: Instagram public post/reel/video in core, public-only policy
- [Initialization]: Markdown default + optional deterministic `--json`
- [Phase 1 Planning]: Contract-first Bun CLI with deterministic placeholder behavior
- [01-01 Execution]: Keep placeholder paths deterministic and non-zero to protect automation correctness.
- [01-02 Execution]: Deferred command verbs stay visible in help but must hard-fail with phase-aware guidance.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Instagram extractor stability may fluctuate; keep adapter isolation and smoke tests active.
